HTML & CSS
Chapter 1 Summary:
HTML stands for Hypertext MarkUp Language.  When one creates an HTML page, they are essentially creating a text document.  The text document consists of tags (also knowns as elements); each tag contains:
  -an opening tag
  -a closing tag (unless it is an <img> <br> and a few others)
  -the content in between the pair of tags
In order to make an element unique, you can add attritubutes which can also allow you to call the tags in JavaScript and CSS.  The attribute belongs in the opening tag and consists of a name and value.  

Chapter 8 Summary:
In this chapter we review HTML, its evolution and more advanced attributes that can make HTML more interactive.  From the time HTML has been created, there has been a total of three different versions: HTML 4, XHTML 1.0, AND HTML5. While we are currently using HTML5, there is bound to be another version and updates to come soon.  Each version comes with its own new features, for example, in HTML5, not all elements need to have a closing tag.  Some other great attributes and features include: 
  -comments using <!-- hello World!-->
  -<div> and <span> which both allow in-line and block 
  -and <meta> which allows one to add more specific information to the HTML document

Chapter 17 Summary:
Chapter 17 reiterates the changes and upgrades that have been made as discussed in Chapter 8.  The new updates and attributes in HTML5 increase readability for developers.  For example, instead of using <div></div> with specific id's inside for every element, you can use elements such as <header> <aside> <article> <footer> etc.

Chapter 18 Summary:
When creating a website, it is crucial that you plan, plan, PLAN!  Before anything is created on the computer, you want to minimize any room for error, and maximize the potential of a successful website.  It is important to keep in mind the type of users that will be visiting the website, what they are visiting for, how long they intend to stay, and of course, if they will return.  All of these questions can be answered on a white board or piece of paper first.  Using site maps is an amazing way of determining all the content and information the website needs, while a wireframe is perfect for laying out how the website will look.  The design of the website is driven by communication and what you are trying to convey to the users.  

JavaScript & JQuery
Chapter 1 Summary:
Chapter 1 covers the fundamentals and foundation concepts of being able to read and write JavaScript; and it all begins with a script.  A script is a series of instructions that tells the computer what to do progmatically.  In order to write a script, you must lay out everything you want the computer to do and break it down further into more steps. Once you figure out what you want the computer to do, you can add that functionality to the information found in HTML5 using the <script> elements.  Altoghter, you end up with a functional website that is built from HTML5(for content and overall layout), CSS(for design and visuals), and JavaScript(for functionality and user interaction).
